# :key: gf-secrets

Secret and/ credential patterns used for `gf`.

## Requirements :sparkles:

- Have `gf` in your machine. [Install now](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf#install) if not ready!

## Getting started :dizzy:

Clone this repository.

```
▶ git clone https://github.com/dwisiswant0/gf-secrets
```

Then copy all JSON pattern files into `~/.gf` directory.

```
▶ cd gf-secrets/
▶ cp -a .gf/ $HOME
```

## Workaround :recycle:


Finding for testing point with [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau) and [fff](https://github.com/tomnomnom/fff).

```
▶ gau -subs [host] | cut -d"?" -f1 | grep -E "\.js(?:onp?)?$" | tee urls.txt
▶ sort -u urls.txt | fff -s 200 -o out/
```

After we save response from known URLs, it's time to digging for secrets.

### Usage :speech_balloon: 

```
▶ for i in `gf -list`; do [[ ${i} =~ "_secrets"* ]] && gf ${i}; done
```

You will see _stdout_ results in your terminal if grep recursively turns match.
